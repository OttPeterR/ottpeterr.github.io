        <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently at school at George Mason University in my junior year of studying computer science.  In my free time I like to teach myself to use different penetration testing tools and understand different security exploits.  My current hobby is breaking VMs from vulnhub.com or I also like to read up on current cyber security news and stay up-to-date with what's going on in the security world. My current focus right now is gaining a better understanding of how networks are secured, and how they aren't. </p>
