        <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently at school at George Mason University in my senior year of studying computer science planning to graduate in the Spring of 2017.  In my free time I like to teach myself to use different penetration testing tools and understand different aspects of security.  My current hobby is breaking VMs from vulnhub.com with Kali Linux to learn more about penetration testing. I also like to read up on current cyber security news and stay up-to-date with what's going on in the security world. My current focus right now is gaining a better understanding of how networks are secured and how they aren't. To do that I'm learning how to use tools both for forensics and for pen testing.</p>
        <h2>hobbies</h2>
        <p>Right now I'm really into Mr. Robot, I really think we've been needing a solid TV show like that for a while. For music I usually put on the electronic station from Google Play Music and listen to that - I'm not too particular about my music. I like to get in a few games of Overwatch (on PC) when I can, I also might get back into Destiny when the new update comes out. I also like to do indoor rock climbing on occasion.</p>
        <h2>current classes</h2>
        <p><b>CS 483 - Algorithms</b>
        <br>A required class, but a good one none-the-less. Very theoretical which is nice change. It's obvious when a program is written well becuase the internal workings of it move smoothly and don't lag. I hope to be able to use what I learn from this class to better the efficiency of my code.
        <br><b>CS 480 - Artificial Intelligence</b>
        <br>This is easily the coolest class I'm taking currently. We started off with K Nearest Neighbor and K Means then Decision Trees and no we're on Neural Networks. I see AI playing an enormous role in the future of the internet and computing and as someone who is very security conscious, I see it playing a role in how cyber security will evolve in the coming years.
        <br><b>CS 471 - Operating Systems</b>
        <br>My interests revolve around security and knowing how things work on a low level is necessary for understanding security. In this class we write our own kernel modules and get more in-depth with how lower level processes work with a focus on Linux but also including Windows and OS X.
        <br><b>CS 469 - Intro to Computer Security</b><br>This class focuses on the higher level consepts and ideas in the field of security. It covers security and integrity models, threat modeling, and analysis of threat logic. 
        <br><b>SOCI 120</b>
        <br> It's a required class for a global understandings credit. It's not too bad.
        </p>
        <h2>currently learning</h2>
        <p><b>Lisp</b> - for CS 480 Artificial Intelligence at GMU
        <br><b>Swift</b> - (and XCode and iOS) writing a basic network analysis app to get a feel for iOS and XCode
        <br><b>C</b> - doing kernel stuff for a class</p>
        <h2>currently reading</h2>
            <p>Designing BSD Rootkits - by Joseph Kong
            <br>ANSI Common Lisp - by Paul Graham</p>
        <h2>VMs</h2>
            <p>Time permitting... I'd like to add some small walk-throughs for some of the VMs I've made it through from vulnhub.com (probably after the semester ends)</p>
