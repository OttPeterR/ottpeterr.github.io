        <h2>about me</h2>
            <p>I'm currently at school at George Mason University in my senior year of studying computer science planning to graduate in the Spring of 2017.  In my free time I like to teach myself to use different penetration testing tools and understand different aspects of security.  My current hobby is breaking VMs from vulnhub.com with Kali Linux to learn more about penetration testing. I also like to read up on current cyber security news and stay up-to-date with what's going on in the security world. My current focus right now is gaining a better understanding of how networks are secured and how they aren't. To do that I'm learning how to use tools both for forensics and for pen testing.</p>
        <h2>hobbies</h2>
        <p>Right now I'm really into Mr. Robot, I really think we've been needing a solid TV show like that for a while. For music I usually put on the electronic station from Google Play Music and listen to that - I'm not too particular about my music. I like to get in a few games of Overwatch (on PC) when I can, I also might get back into Destiny when the new update comes out. As much as I'd like to, I don't just sit all day. I take walks and am getting back into running after an injury last winter. I also like to do indoor rock climbing on occasion.</p>
        <h2>currently learning</h2>
